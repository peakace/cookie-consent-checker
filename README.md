Cookie Consent Checker 

Since the EU adopted the GDPR and introduced corresponding cookie guidelines, it is mandatory to implement a cookie consent banner on one's own website. Such a banner can decide to what extent data can still be collected for analyses and thus for your own marketing. It is therefore important that as many visitors as possible to your site, to whom the website banner is displayed, accept it. Meanwhile, there are countless providers of consent management platforms (CMPs), but there are hardly any actually meaningful analyses of banner behavior. For this reason, we have created a GTM Cookie Consent Checker Template, which allows detailed analysis of the banner behavior of its users. How you can implement this on your website is explained below.
